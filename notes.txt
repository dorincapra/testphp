Product SKU1 does not have the 10% Discount applied because of the RULE in Rule.php. 
In the right(second) operand, the operator is "GREATER" than the value - 100. And the price of SKU1 is 50 - it does not qualify for discount. 
In order for the discount to be applied to SKU1 as well, we need to change the way the rule is applied.
